<p> Here is a link to my game, PPF: <a href ="PPF.html"> PPF.html </a> </p>


  <h1> Abstract </h1>
  <p>This Digital Narrative, created on Bitsy, is named PPF, an acronym for Past, Present, and Future, created by Gavin Heaver. The objective of the game is to solve 3 separate issues in, appropriately, the past, the present, and the future. Along with the issues, the player will discover aspects of AI from these timelines, with some hidden comedic messages among the NPCs. The story is based on the article “A Brief History of Artificial Intelligence: On the Past, Present, and Future of Artificial Intelligence,” by Micheal Haelein and Andreas Kaplan. Within this article is a deep dive of the history and expectations of Artificial Intelligence, looking at things like the first thoughts of AI, its creation and development, and importance of how humans respond to it within the future, dealing with things like regulations and employment. </p>
