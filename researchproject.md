# Abstract
Ever since the dawn of time, humans have always attempted to evolve and reach for greater accomplishments. Its starts with caveman unlocking the potential of fire, where it has steadily increased in the thousands of years of experience that humanity has. Especially in the past 100 years, each generation seems to have gained “their” accomplishment, like achieving flight, going to the moon, enabling the internet, and seems like we found our next big jump: artificial intelligence. The topic of artificial intelligence has been around for decades, with some of the first clear signs of it being found in the 1942 book Runaround by Issac Asimov (Haenlein). From there, artificial intelligence has been researched and developed, but for most of the time since the 1940s, it has been relatively tame. However, there has been a boom in the previous years concerning artificial intelligence. Using Chatling, I explored artificial intelligence where a greater understanding of it can be found. This research has a wide scope to give a proper grasp on what artificial intelligence is as a whole and how it impacts humanity. It can discuss the origins and future of artificial intelligence, both as an idea and as a technology since its birth during World War 2 (Haenlein) to its future as a technology and questions humanity has to ask (Peeters). There is information on the various definitions of artificial intelligence and technology with AI, like looking at it as a concept where you place human knowledge into technology (Abbass) versus looking at it from a technical standpoint with machine learning (Stultz) as well as chatbots and image creation (Teubner).  It explores artificial intelligence’s relationship with humanity, such as the creative power of AI in art (Zheng), the perception of killing creativity or spreading misinformation to people (Elston), its use in the workforce to help or replace people (Poba-Nzaou), the various ways people perceive artificial intelligence (Alizadeh), the psychological connections that people have formed (Kirk), and the ethical questions needed to be answered when using AI (Siau).
